This repository contains Jupyter Notebooks implementing multiple steps for performing air temperature (AT) interpolation based on employs a Random Forest regression framework. The method is based on authoritative ARPA and crowdsourced CML meteorological stations data and geospatial and EO predictors. It focuses on HW periods, estimated from reanalysis data over Italy [VHR-REA_IT](https://dds.cmcc.it/#/dataset/era5-downscaled-over-italy/hourly).

For more information please see the published paper: "Predicting air temperature patterns in Milan using crowdsourced measurements and Earth Observation data" published in the _Remote Sensing_ journal, DOI: XXX.

The prerequisite for replicating the method is a set of predictors prepared on a common grid and a set of stations.
